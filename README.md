Systems Analysis and Design

The DriverPass project required developers to create a cloud-based web platform for DriverPass which operated as a company dedicated to helping students succeed in DMV driving tests through their combination of online education and behind-the-wheel instruction. The system required students to register and schedule lessons online while instructors tracked student progress and administrators managed user accounts and generated reports and maintained DMV compliance. The system required security features and flexibility and device accessibility to enhance operational efficiency and student learning success.

I successfully converted all business objectives from the client into specific functional and nonfunctional requirements during this project. The system design process received accurate representation through my work on use cases and diagrams which showed user interactions with the system. I would make the class diagram more understandable for future developers by simplifying its design to show data structures and relationships more clearly. I studied the interview transcript to determine each stakeholder's objectives and limitations which focused on creating an interface that provides user-friendly access to accurate data. The system requirements must align with actual user workflows because user needs represent the foundation for successful system development. My software design method involves multiple stages of development which use UML diagrams and user stories and feedback validation to create models. I will enhance my development approach by implementing user-focused design methods and interface optimization techniques to build systems which deliver both technical excellence and user-friendly functionality.
